Cretonne has been renamed to Cranelift! For future versions, see the
[`cranelift`](https://crates.io/crates/cranelift) crate.

This is an umbrella crate which contains no code of its own, but pulls in
other cretonne library crates to provide a convenient one-line dependency,
and a prelude, for common use cases.
