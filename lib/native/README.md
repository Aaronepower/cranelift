Cretonne has been renamed to Cranelift! For future versions, see the
[`cranelift-native`](https://crates.io/crates/cranelift-native) crate.

This crate performs autodetection of the host architecture, which can be used to
configure [Cretonne](https://crates.io/crates/cretonne) to generate code
specialized for the machine it's running on.
