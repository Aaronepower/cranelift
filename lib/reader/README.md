Cretonne has been renamed to Cranelift! For future versions, see the
[`cranelift-reader`](https://crates.io/crates/cranelift-reader) crate.

This crate library supports reading .cton files. This functionality is needed
for testing [Cretonne](https://crates.io/crates/cretonne), but is not essential
for a JIT compiler.
